>A tiny lib for open native platform voice regonizer in react native.
## Motivation
<a href="https://github.com/react-native-community">`react-native-community`<a/> provides an awesome <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/voice">@react-native-community/voice</a> for reconiting voice but sometimes you dont need to create your own voice reconizer also you want only recogniting with Google Assistant .
## Feautures
  - native impelemation :chart_with_upwards_trend: .
  - easy to use :heart_eyes: ( only have one method ) .
  - no `ios` support :hankey: ( may be add in future ) .
## Result
<a href="https://gifyu.com/image/lslg"><img src="https://s6.gifyu.com/images/3w0l7v.gif" alt="3w0l7v.gif" border="0" /></a>
## Installation
use  yarn  

```bash
yarn add react-native-voice-recognizer
```

or with npm
```bash
npm i react-native-voice-recognizer
```
 <br><br>
if you are using RN@>=0.60 you dont need any more enjoy RN auto-linking with `npx react-native run-android` <br><br> but for RN@<0.60 you need to `link` with `react-native link` or linking manually .
>manully linking will add soon here.

## Usage

first import 
```js
import VoiceRecognizer from 'react-native-voice-recognizer';
```
