>A tiny lib for open native platform voice regonizer in react native.
# Motivation
<a href="https://github.com/react-native-community">`react-native-community`<a/> provides an awesome <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/voice">@react-native-community/voice</a> for reconiting voice but sometime you dont need to create your own voice reconizer also want to use native platform dialog .
